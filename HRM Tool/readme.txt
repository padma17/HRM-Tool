Project Description:
The motive of developing this application is to make the life of HR easier.
This application mainly focus to display all the relevant candidate information in table format.


Framework used:
Bootstrap along with Datatable.
The advantage of using DataTables is that we can integrate seamlessly with Bootstrap using Bootstrap's table styling options to present an interface with a uniform design, based on Bootstrap, for our site / app.
Its an integration which provides a renderer for the sorting control in DataTables to ensure that the sorting/search of the table is also styled consistently by Bootstrap.


Sorting of Table:
Sorting of table could be performed by using arrow keys/clicking the column headers. By default I have kept "Position Applied" column aligned in ascending order.
Furthur,Other columns sorting can be performed by using arrow keys.

JSON File:
I have taken the data dynamically from the user by parsing the JSON file into required format into the table body.

Steps to run the application:

Step1: Download the WAR file from the GIT repository.
Step2: Run the personio.html using Chrome Browser.
